## Design Decisions

### Architecture
Explain your MVC structure:
- How did you separate model, view, controller?
- What interfaces/abstractions did you create?
- Why did you choose Swing vs JavaFX?

### Data Structures
- How do you represent game state? (arrays, maps, objects?)
- Why did you choose these structures?

### Algorithms
- Key algorithms implemented (e.g., collision detection, word validation)
- Complexity analysis (Big-O) if relevant
